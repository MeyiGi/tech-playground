# PyTest Useful Patterns

 - [FIRST-TEST](https://github.com/MeyiGi/PyTest/tree/main/FIRST-TEST) - Simple Test, easy to make, working with assert
 - [CLASS-BASED-TEST](https://github.com/MeyiGi/PyTest/tree/main/CLASS-BASED-TEST) - Test Classes
 - [FIXTURES](https://github.com/MeyiGi/PyTest/tree/main/FIXTURES) - Pytest fixtures are a powerful feature that allows you to set up and tear down resources needed for your tests
 - [MARKS](https://github.com/MeyiGi/PyTest/tree/main/MARKS) - Pytest markers are a powerful feature that allows you to add metadata or labels to your test functions
 - [PARAMETRIZE](https://github.com/MeyiGi/PyTest/tree/main/PARAMATRIZE) - Parameterized tests allow a developer to run the same test over and over again on different values
 - [MOCK](https://github.com/MeyiGi/PyTest/tree/main/MOCK) - Mock tests are practice tests that are designed to be similar to actual exams
