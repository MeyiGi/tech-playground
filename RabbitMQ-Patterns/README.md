# Here all important Patterns about RabbitMQ üêá




## Acknowledgements

 - [The Easiest Pattern](https://github.com/MeyiGi/RabbitMQ-Patterns/tree/main/FIRST-RABBITMQ-APP) - Basic Message broker within one producer and consumer
 - [Competing Consume Pattern](https://github.com/MeyiGi/RabbitMQ-Patterns/tree/main/COMPETTING_SONSUME_PATTERN) - It is pattern like first but with while or for cycle
 - [SUBPUB Pattern](https://github.com/MeyiGi/RabbitMQ-Patterns/tree/main/SUBPUB_PATTERN) - One producer sending one message for several consumer
 - [Routing Pattern](https://github.com/MeyiGi/RabbitMQ-Patterns/tree/main/ROUTING) - Producer sending specific data to concrete consumer
 - [Request-Reply-Pattern](https://github.com/MeyiGi/RabbitMQ-Patterns/tree/main/REQUEST-REPLY-PATTERN) - It's like http, where client want specific data providing some information the server in turn sends, where client is simultaneously producer and consumer like client
 - [Exchange-Exchange-Pattern](https://github.com/MeyiGi/RabbitMQ-Patterns/tree/main/EXCHANGE-EXCHANGE-PATTERN) - Exchange sending message to another exchange, this pattern mostly used in complex apps
 - [Headers-Exchange-Pattern](https://github.com/MeyiGi/RabbitMQ-Patterns/tree/main/HEADERS-EXCHANGE) - Headers Exchange Type is the most powerful exchange type in RabbitMQ ‚Äì AMQP. Headers exchanges route a message based on the message headers matching, they ignore routing keys.
 - [Consitent-Hashing-Exchange-Pattern](https://github.com/MeyiGi/RabbitMQ-Patterns/tree/main/CONSISTENT-HASHING_EXCHANGE) - Consistent Hashing Exchange It distributes messages among queues bound to it, without overloading the application (Don't forget enable Consistent Hashing)
