# Here all important Thingd about Docker üêã

## Acknowledgements

 - Docker - Docker is a tool that speeds up the process of creating, testing, and deploying applications by using containers. It packages an application into a container, which contains all the necessary elements for the application to operate. This container can then be run on any system, making it highly versatile. Docker is offered as free, open-source software and as a paid, commercial product.
 - Images - A Docker image is a file used to execute code in a Docker container. Docker images act as a set of instructions to build a Docker cotainer, such as a template. Docker images also act as the starting point when using Docker. An image is comparable to a snapshot in virtual machine (VM) environments.
 - Contaner - Containers are packages of software that have all the files and dependencies required to run in any environment, including application code, runtime, system libraries, and system tools. By virtualizing the operating system, containers can run in dev, test, and production environments, or in any computing environment from personal devices to public clouds or private data centers.
 - Dockerfile - A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a series of instructions for automatically building a Docker image. The file defines the steps Docker should take to create a container with the required configuration and software environment.
