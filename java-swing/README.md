They play a crucial role in creating the visual structure of a Java application, allowing developers to organize and manage the user interface effectively. Panels are instances of the JPanel class, a part of the Swing library, which is widely used for building interactive desktop applications in Java.
 - [JButtons](https://github.com/MeyiGi/tech-playground/tree/main/java-swing/buttons) - Buttons can be configured, and to some degree controlled, by Actions. Using an Action with a button has many benefits beyond directly configuring a button. Refer to Swing Components Supporting Action for more details, and you can find more information in How to Use Actions, a section in The Java Tutorial.
